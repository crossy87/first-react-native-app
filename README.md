# first-react-native-app

I followed a code-along tutorial using Udemy to create my first react native app. I learned about using Expo to demo/preview the appliction on my iPhone and had an opportunity to see how similar React and React Native are. I also picked up some tips regarding stylesheets and clarified my understanding of state vs props.
